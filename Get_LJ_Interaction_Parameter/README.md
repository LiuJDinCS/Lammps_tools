# Lammps_tools  (Generally used for lammps input) 
# Get LJ Interaction parameter



A small program for obtaining LJ interactions between different elements from the UFF force field (a universal force developed by Rappe et al).


You want to get the LJ interaction parameters of different elements, just put the LJ_data.csv and Get_Interaction_parameter.m files in the same folder, and run the .m file.


Please contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
