## Get_LJ_Interaction_parameter

A small program for obtaining LJ interactions between different elements from the UFF force field (a universal force developed by Rappe et al).

These parameters are very useful for constructing a two-dimensional (2D) vertical heterostructure composed of a van der Waals force interaction.
And they are also very useful for building multi-layer 2D materials.

## How to Use

You want to get the LJ interaction parameters of different elements, just put the LJ_data.csv and Get_Interaction_parameter.m files in the same folder, and run the .m file.
The specific calculation process of these parameters can be viewed in the Formula.pdf file.

Please contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
